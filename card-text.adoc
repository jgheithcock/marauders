# The Last Christmas Present

## A Scavenger Hunt in Words

_There was one present left under the Christmas tree, a wooden box with a tag that said 'I open at the close'_

When my daughter turned thirteen, I made a scavenger hunt to her last Christmas present using a Marauder's Map of our house. Use the map to find the clues and discover how to piece them together to find her present.
