About the Story
---------------

*There was one present left under the Christmas tree, a wooden box with a tag
that said 'I open at the close.'*

When my daughter turned thirteen, I made a scavenger hunt to her last Christmas
present using a Marauderâ€™s Map of our house. Use the map to find the clues and
discover how to piece them together to find her present.
