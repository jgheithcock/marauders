The Last Christmas Present: A Scavenger Hunt in Words

"There was one present left under the Christmas tree, a wooden box with a tag that said 'I open at the close'"

When my daughter turned thirteen, I made a scavenger hunt to her last Christmas present using a Marauderâ€™s Map of our house. Use the map to find the clues and discover how to piece them together to find her present.
